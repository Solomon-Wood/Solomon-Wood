### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Solomon Wood, a C and C++ developer. And possibly Swift too! You can see for yourself:

![GitHub Stats!](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Solomon-Wood&layout=compact&bg_color=30,b3ffe4,b3efff)

Right now I am working on a set of C libraries/frameworks which are similar to those included by default in Objective-C.
I am not very far yet, but again you can see for yourself:
